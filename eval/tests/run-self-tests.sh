#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-self-tests.sh — self-test suite for eval/check-skill.sh.
#
# Runs the static harness against the pathological fixture skills under
# eval/tests/fixtures/ and asserts, per fixture: (a) the expected exit code,
# (b) presence of the specific expected PASS/WARN/FAIL lines, (c) absence of
# unexpected FAILs. Prints one PASS/FAIL line per fixture plus a summary.
#
# Contract:
#   bash eval/tests/run-self-tests.sh        # from the repo root (any cwd works:
#                                            # the script cd's to the repo root)
#   exit 0  -> every fixture behaved as asserted
#   exit 1  -> at least one assertion failed (diff-style detail + full harness
#              output for the failing fixture is printed)
#
# Date sensitivity: the clean-pass fixture's tests.md carries a
# "Last verified:" date that will eventually age past the 90-day staleness
# window, flipping Check 14 from PASS to WARN. Assertions here are therefore
# freshness-INSENSITIVE for that fixture: we assert specific check outcomes
# and FAIL absence, never the Check 14 PASS line or total WARN counts. No
# yearly refresh is required for the suite to stay green, but refreshing the
# date keeps clean-pass a true zero-noise baseline.
